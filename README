This is an extremely basic example of a Cucumber plus Webdriver test suite.

- It is a completely standalone and fully functionaly test suite
- It can be integrated into a continuous integration system like Jenkins
- It can produce human readable HTML reports with screenshots of failures

Many more features can be adding by iterating out on this basic skeleton

To run it:
- cucumber
- cucumber -f pretty -f junit -o results
- cucumber -f pretty -f junit -o results -f html -o report.html
